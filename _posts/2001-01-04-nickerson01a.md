title: Using Unsupervised Learning to Guide Resampling in Imbalanced Data Sets
abstract: The class imbalance problem causes a classifier to over-fit the data belonging
  to the class with the greatest number of training examples. The purpose of this
  paper is to argue that methods that equalize class membership are not as effective
  as possible when applied blindly and that improvements can be obtained by adjusting
  for the within-class imbalance. A guided resampling technique is proposed and tested
  within a simpler letter recognition domain and a more difficult text classification
  domain. A fast unsupervised clustering technique, Principal Direction Divisive Partitioning
  (PDDP), is used to determine the internal characteristics of each class. The performance
  improvement in categories that suffer from a large between-class imbalance (few
  positive examples) are shown to be improved when using the guided resampling method.
