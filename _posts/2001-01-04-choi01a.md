abstract: Markov decision processes (HM-MDPs) are a novel mathematical framework for
  a subclass of nonstationary reinforcement learning problems where environment dynamics
  change over time according to a Markov process. HM-MDPs are a special case of partially
  observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs), and therefore nonstationary problems
  of this type can in principle be addressed indirectly via existing POMDP algorithms.
  However, previous research has shown that such an indirect approach is inefficient
  compared with a direct HM-MDP approach in terms of the model learning time. In this
  paper, we investigate how to solve HM-MDP problems efficiently by using a direct
  approach. We exploit the HM-MDP structure and derive an equation for dynamic programming
  update. Our equation decomposes the value function into a number of components and
  as a result, substantially reduces the amount of computations in finding optimal
  policies. Based on the incremental pruning and point-based improvement techniques,
  a value iteration algorithm is also implemented. Empirical results show that the
  HM-MDP approach outperforms the POMDP one several order of magnitude with respect
  to both space requirement and speed.
