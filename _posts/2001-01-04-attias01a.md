title: 'Learning in high dimensions: Modular Mixture Models'
abstract: We present a new approach to learning prob- abilistic models for high dimensional
  data. This approach divides the data dimensions into low dimensional subspaces,
  and learns a separate mixture model for each subspace. The models combine in a principled
  manner to form a flexible modular network that pro- duces a total density estimate.
  We derive and demonstrate an iterative learning algorithm that uses only local information.
