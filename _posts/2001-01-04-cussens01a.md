abstract: Stochastic logic programs (SLPs) and the various distributions they define
  are presented with a stress on their characterisation in terms of Markov chains.
  Sampling, parameter estimation and structure learning for SLPs are discussed. The
  application of SLPs to Bayesian learning, computational linguistics and computational
  biology are considered. Laffertyâ€™s Gibbs-Markov models are compared and contrasted
  with SLPs.
