title: Variational Learning for Multi-Layer Networks of Linear Threshold Units
abstract: Linear threshold units (LTUs) were originally proposed as models of biological
  neurons. They were widely studied in the context of the perceptron (Rosenblatt,
  1962). Due to the difficulties of finding a general algorithm for networks with
  hidden nodes, they never passed into general use. In this work we derive an algorithm
  in the context of probabilistic models and show how it may be applied in multi-layer
  networks of LTUs. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithm on three data-sets.
