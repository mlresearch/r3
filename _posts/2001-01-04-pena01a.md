title: Geographical Clustering of Cancer Incidence by Means of Bayesian Networks and
  Conditional Gaussian Networks
abstract: With the aim of improving knowledge on the geographical distribution and
  characterization of malignant tumors in the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country
  (Spain), age-standardized cancer incidence rates of the 6 most frequent cancer types
  for patients of each sex between 1986 and 1994 are analyzed, in relation to the
  towns of the Community. Concretely, we perform a geographical clustering of the
  towns of the Community by means of Bayesian networks and conditional Gaussian networks.
  We present several maps that show the clusterings encoded by the learnt models.
  In addition to this, we outline the cancer incidence profile for each of the obtained
  clusters.
