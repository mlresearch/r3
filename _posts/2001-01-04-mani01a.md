title: A Simulation Study of Three Related Causal Data Mining Algorithms
abstract: In all scientific domains causality plays a significant role. This study
  focused on evaluating and refining efficient algorithms to learn causal relationships
  from observational data. Evaluation of learned causal output is difficult, due to
  lack of a gold standard in real-world domains. Therefore, we used simulated data
  from a known causal network in a medical domain-the Alarm network. For causal discovery
  we used three variants of the Local Causal Discovery (LCD) algorithms, that are
  referred to as LCDa, LCDb and LCDc. These algorithms use the framework of causal
  Bayesian Networks to represent causal relationships among model variables. LCDa,
  LCDb and LCDe take as input a dataset and a partial node ordering, and output purported
  causes of the form variable $Y$ causally influences variable $Z$. Using the simulated
  Alarm dataset as input, LCDa had a false positive rate of $0.09$, LCDb $0.08$ and
  LCDc 0.04. All the algorithms had a true positive rate of about 0.27 . Most of the
  false positives occurred when a causal relationship was confounded. LCDc output
  as causal only those causally confounded pairs that had very weak confounding. We
  identify and discuss the causally confounded relationships that often seem to induce
  false positive results.
