title: Can the Computer Learn to Play Music Expressively?
abstract: A computer system is described that provides a real-time musical accompaniment
  for a live soloist in a piece of non-improvised music. A Bayesian belief network
  is developed that represents the joint distribution on the times at which the solo
  and accompaniment notes are played as well as many hidden variables. The network
  models several important sources of information including the information contained
  in the score and the rhythmic interpretations of the soloist and accompaniment which
  are learned from examples. The network is used to provide a computationally efficient
  decision-making engine that utilizes all available information while producing a
  flexible and musical accompaniment.
