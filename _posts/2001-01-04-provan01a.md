title: Stochastic System Monitoring and Control
abstract: In this article we propose a new technique for efficiently solving a specialized
  instance of a finite state sequential decision process. This specialized task requires
  keeping a system within a set of nominal states, introducing control actions only
  when forbidden states are entered. Instead of assuming that the process evolves
  only due to control actions, we assume that system evolution occurs due to both
  internal system dynamics and control actions, referred to as endogenous and exogenous
  evolution respectively. Since controls are needed only for exogenous evolution,
  we separate inference for the case of endogenous and exogenous evolution, obtaining
  an inference method that is computationally simpler than using a standard POMDP
  framework for solving this task. We summarize the problem framework and the algorithm
  for performing sequential decision-making.
