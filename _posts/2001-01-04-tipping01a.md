title: A Kernel Approach for Vector Quantization with Guaranteed Distortion Bounds
abstract: We propose a kernel method for vector quantization and clustering. Our approach
  allows a priori specification of the maximally allowed distortion, and it automatically
  finds a sufficient representative subset of the data to act as codebook vectors
  (or cluster centres). It does not find the minimal number of such vectors, which
  would amount to a combinatorial problem; however, we find a ’good’ quantization
  through linear programming.
