title: Finding a path is harder than finding a tree
abstract: This note shows that the problem of learning an optimal chain graphical
  model from data is NP-hard for the Bayesian, maximum likelihood, and minimum description
  length approaches. This hardness result holds despite the fact that the problem
  is a restriction of the polynomially solvable problem of finding the optimal tree
  graphical model.
