title: An Anytime Algorithm for Causal Inference
abstract: The Fast Casual Inference (FCI) algorithm searches for features common to
  observationally equivalent sets of causal directed acyclic graphs. It is correct
  in the large sample limit with probability one even if there is a possibility of
  hidden variables and selection bias. In the worst case, the number of conditional
  independence tests performed by the algorithm grows exponentially with the number
  of variables in the data set. This affects both the speed of the algorithm and the
  accuracy of the algorithm on small samples, because tests of independence conditional
  on large numbers of variables have very low power. In this paper, I prove that the
  FCI algorithm can be interrupted at any stage and asked for output. The output from
  the interrupted algorithm is still correct with probability one in the large sample
  limit, although possibly less informative (in the sense that it answers "Canâ€™t tell"
  for a larger number of questions) than if the FCI algorithm had been allowed to
  continue uninterrupted.
