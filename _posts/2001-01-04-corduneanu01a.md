abstract: Mixture models, in which a probability distribution is represented as a
  linear superposition of component distributions, are widely used in statistical
  modeling and pattern recognition. One of the key tasks in the application of mixture
  models is the determination of a suitable number of components. Conventional approaches
  based on cross-validation are computationally expensive, are wasteful of data, and
  give noisy estimates for the optimal number of components. A fully Bayesian treatment,
  based on Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for instance, will return a posterior
  distribution over the number of components. However, in practical applications it
  is generally convenient, or even computationally essential, to select a single,
  most appropriate model. Recently it has been shown, in the context of linear latent
  variable models, that the use of hierarchical priors governed by continuous hyperparameters
  whose values are set by typeII maximum likelihood, can be used to optimize model
  complexity. In this paper we extend this framework to mixture distributions by considering
  the classical task of density estimation using mixtures of Gaussians. We show that,
  by setting the mixing coefficients to maximize the marginal log-likelihood, unwanted
  components can be suppressed, and the appropriate number of components for the mixture
  can be determined in a single training run without recourse to crossvalidation.
  Our approach uses a variational treatment based on a factorized approximation to
  the posterior distribution.
