title: An improved training algorithm for kernel Fisher discriminants
abstract: We present a fast training algorithm for the kernel Fisher discriminant
  classifier. It uses a greedy approximation technique and has an empirical scaling
  behavior which improves upon the state of the art by more than an order of magnitude,
  thus rendering the kernel Fisher algorithm a viable option also for large datasets.
