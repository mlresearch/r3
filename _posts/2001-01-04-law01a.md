abstract: We show that the Bayesian evidence framework can be applied to both $\epsilon$-support
  vector regression ($\epsilon$-SVR) and $\nu$-support vector regression ($\nu$-SVR)
  algorithms. Standard SVR training can be regarded as performing level one inference
  of the evidence framework, while levels two and three allow automatic adjustments
  of the regularization and kernel parameters respectively, without the need of a
  validation set.
