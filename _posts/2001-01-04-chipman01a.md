abstract: Recent research in model selection and adaptive modeling has produced an
  embarrassment of riches. By using any one of several different techniques, an analyst
  is able to generate a number of models that describe the same data set well. Examples
  include multiple tree models generated by bootstrapping or stochastic searches,
  and different subsets of variables in linear regression models identified by stochastic
  or exhaustive searches. While model averaging can use these models to improve prediction
  accuracy, interpretation of the resultant models becomes difficult. We seek a compromise,
  developing measures of dissimilarity between different models and using these to
  select good models which may reveal different aspects of the data. Data on housing
  prices in Boston are used to illustrate this in the context of treed regression
  models.
