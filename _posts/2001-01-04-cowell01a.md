title: On searching for optimal classifiers among Bayesian networks
abstract: There is much interest in constructing from datasets Bayesian networks which
  are efficient, or even optimal, for classification purposes. Most search strategies
  usually discriminate between networks by comparing their marginal likelihood score,
  but recently it has been suggested that search strategies for classifiers should
  instead select among models using alternative scores. This paper contributes to
  this discussion by presenting the results of simulations on the sets of all directed
  acyclic graphs on four and five nodes. Our results add evidence to earlier indications
  that the marginal likelihood is likely to be a poor criterion to use for classifier
  selection.
