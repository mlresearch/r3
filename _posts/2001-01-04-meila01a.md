title: A Random Walks View of Spectral Segmentation
abstract: We present a new view of clustering and segmentation by pairwise similarities.
  We interpret the similarities as edge flows in a Markov random walk and study the
  eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the walk’s transition matrix. This view shows that
  spectral methods for clustering and segmentation have a probabilistic foundation.
  We prove that the Normalized Cut method arises naturally from our framework and
  we provide a complete characterization of the cases when the Normalized Cut algorithm
  is exact. Then we discuss other spectral segmentation and clustering methods showing
  that several of them are essentially the same as NCut.
