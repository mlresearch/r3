title: Online Bagging and Boosting
abstract: Bagging and boosting are well-known ensemble learning methods. They combine
  multiple learned base models with the aim of improving generalization performance.
  To date, they have been used primarily in batch mode, and no effective online versions
  have been proposed. We present simple online bagging and boosting algorithms that
  we claim perform as well as their batch counterparts.
