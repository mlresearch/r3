title: Dual perturb and combine algorithm
abstract: In this paper, a dual perturb and combine algorithm is proposed which consists
  in producing the perturbed predictions at the prediction stage using only one model.
  To this end, the attribute vector of a test case is perturbed several times by an
  additive random noise, the model is applied to each of these perturbed vectors and
  the resulting predictions are aggregated. An analytical version of this algorithm
  is described in the context of decision tree induction. From experiments on several
  datasets, it appears that this simple algorithm yields significant improvements
  on several problems, sometimes comparable to those obtained with bagging. When combined
  with decision tree bagging, this algorithm also improves accuracy in many problems.
