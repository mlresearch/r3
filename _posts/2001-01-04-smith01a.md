title: The Efficient Propagation of Arbitrary Subsets of Beliefs in Discrete-Valued
  Bayesian Networks
abstract: The paper describes an approach for propagating arbitrary subsets of beliefs
  in Bayesian Belief Networks. The method is based on a multiple message passing scheme
  in junction trees. A hybrid tree structure is introduced, both for the propagation
  of evidence and as an efficiently permutable representation of a decomposable graph.
  The use of maximal prime subgraph decompositions and tree permutations to reduce
  computational cost is demonstrated.
