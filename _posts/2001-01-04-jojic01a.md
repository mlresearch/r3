title: Learning mixtures of smooth, nonuniform deformation models for probabilistic
  image matching
abstract: By representing images and image prototypes by linear subspaces spanned
  by "tangent vectors" (derivatives of an image with respect to translation, rotation,
  etc.), impressive invariance to known types of uniform distortion can be built into
  feedforward discriminators. We describe a new probability model that can jointly
  cluster data and learn mixtures of nonuniform, smooth deformation fields. Our fields
  are based on low-frequency wavelets, so they use very few parameters to model a
  wide range of smooth deformations (unlike, e.g., factor analysis, which uses a large
  number of parameters to model deformations). We give results on handwritten digit
  recognition and face recognition.
