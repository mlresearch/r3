title: 'Monte-Carlo Algorithms for the Improvement of Finite-State Stochastic Controllers:
  Application to Bayes-Adaptive Markov Decision Processes'
abstract: We consider the problem of "optimal learning" for Markov decision processes
  with uncertain transition probabilities. Motivated by the correspondence between
  these processes and partially-observable Markov decision processes, we adopt policies
  expressed as finite-state stochastic automata, and we propose policy improvement
  algorithms that utilize Monte-Carlo techniques for gradient estimation and ascent.
