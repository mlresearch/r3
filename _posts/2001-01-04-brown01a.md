title: Products of Hidden Markov Models
abstract: We present products of hidden Markov models (PoHMM’s), a way of combining
  HMM’s to form a distributed state time series model. Inference in a PoHMM is tractable
  and efficient. Learning of the parameters, although intractable, can be effectively
  done using the Product of Experts learning rule. The distributed state helps the
  model to explain data which has multiple causes, and the fact that each model need
  only explain part of the data means a PoHMM can capture longer range structure than
  an HMM is capable of. We show some results on modelling character strings, a simple
  language task and the symbolic family trees problem, which highlight these advantages.
