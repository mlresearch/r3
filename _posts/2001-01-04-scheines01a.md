title: Piecewise Linear Instrumental Variable Estimation of Causal Influence
abstract: Instrumental Variable (IV) estimation is a powerful strategy for estimating
  causal  influence, even in the presence of confounding. Standard IV estimation requires
  that the relationships between variables is linear. Here we relax the linearity
  requirement by constructing a piecewise linear IV estimator. Simulation studies
  show that when the causal influence of $X$ on $Y$ is non-linear, the piecewise linear
  is an improvement.
