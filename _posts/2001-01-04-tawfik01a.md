title: Temporal Matching under Uncertainty
abstract: Temporal matching is the problem of matching observations to predefined
  temporal patterns or templates. This problem arises in many applications including
  medical and model-based diagnosis, plan-recognition, and temporal databases. This
  work examines the sources of uncertainty in temporal matching and presents a probabilistic
  technique to perform temporal matching under uncertainty. This technique is then
  applied to the problem of finding the onset of infection with \emph{Toxoplasma Gondii}.
