abstract: In this study, we applied the local learning paradigm and conditional independence
  assumptions to control the rapid growth of the dimensionality introduced by multivariate
  time series. We also combined various univariate time series with different stationary
  assumptions in temporal models. These techniques are applied to learn simple Bayesian
  networks from temporal data and to predict survival probabilities of ICU patients
  on every day of their ICU stay.
