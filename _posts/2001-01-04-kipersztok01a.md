abstract: Empirical study of sensitivity analysis on a Bayesian network examines the
  effects of varying the networkâ€™s probability parameters on the posterior probabilities
  of the true hypothesis. One appealing approach to modeling the uncertainty of the
  probability parameters is to add normal noise to the log-odds of the nominal probabilities.
  However, the paper argues that differences in sensitivities found on true hypothesis
  may only be valid in the range of standard deviations where the log-odds normal
  distribution is unimodal. The paper also shows that using average posterior probabilities
  as criterion to measure the sensitivity may not be the most indicative, especially
  when the distribution is very asymmetric as is the case at nominal values close
  to zero or one. It is proposed, instead, to use the partial ordering of the most
  probable causes of diagnosis, measured by a suitable lower confidence bound. The
  paper also presents the preliminary results of our sensitivity analysis experiments
  with three Bayesian networks built for diagnosis of airplane systems. Our results
  show that some networks are more sensitive to imprecision in probabilities than
  previously believed.
