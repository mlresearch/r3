abstract: Bagging is a method of obtaining more robust predictions when the model
  class under consideration is unstable with respect to the data, i.e., small changes
  in the data can cause the predicted values to change significantly. In this paper,
  we introduce a Bayesian version of bagging based on the Bayesian bootstrap. The
  Bayesian bootstrap resolves a theoretical problem with ordinary bagging and often
  results in more efficient estimators. We show how model averaging can be combined
  within the Bayesian bootstrap and illustrate the procedure with several examples.
