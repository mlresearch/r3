abstract: Classifying objects according to their proximity is the fundamental task
  of pattern recognition and arises as a classification problem or discriminant analysis
  in experimental sciences. Here we consider a particular point of view on discriminant
  analysis from a dissimilarity data table. We develop a new approach, inspired from
  the Gaussian model in discriminant analysis, which defines a set a decision rules
  from simple statistics on the dissimilarity matrix between observations. This matrix
  can be only sparse dealing with huge databases. Numerical experiments on artificial
  and real data (proteins classification) show interesting behaviour compared to a
  $K$NN classifier, (i) equivalent error rate, (ii) dramatically lower CPU times and
  (iii) more robustness with sparse dissimilarity structure up to $40 %$ of actual
  dissimilarity measures.
