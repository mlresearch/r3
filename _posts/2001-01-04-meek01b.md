title: The Learning Curve Method Applied to Clustering
abstract: We describe novel fast learning curve methods—methods for scaling inductive
  methods to large data sets—and their application to clustering. We describe the
  decision theoretic underpinnings of the approach and demonstrate significant performance
  gains on two real-world data sets.
