title: Models for Conditional Probability Tables in Educational Assessment
abstract: Experts in educational assessment can often identify the skills needed to
  provide a solution for a test item and which patterns of those skills pro duce better
  expected performance. The method described here combines judgements about the structure
  of the conditional probability table (e.g., conjunctive or compensatory) with Item
  Response Theory methods for partial credit scoring (Samejima, 1969) to produce a
  conditional probability table or a prior distribution for a learning algorithm.
  The structural judgements induce a projection of each configuration of parent skill
  variables onto a single latent response-propensity $\theta$. This is then used to
  calculate a probability for each cell in the table.
