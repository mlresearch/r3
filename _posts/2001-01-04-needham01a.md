title: Message Length as an Effective Ockham’s Razor in Decision Tree Induction
abstract: The validity of the Ockham’s Razor principle is a topic of much debate.
  A series of empirical investigations have sought to discredit the principle by the
  application of decision trees to learning tasks using node cardinality as the objective
  function. As a response to these papers, we suggest that the message length of a
  hypothesis can be used as an effective interpretation of Ockham’s Razor, resulting
  in positive empirical support for the principle. The theoretical justification for
  this Bayesian interpretation is also investigated.
