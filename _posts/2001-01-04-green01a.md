abstract: In this work, techniques for classification with missing or unreliable data
  are applied to the problem of noise-robustness in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR).
  The primary advantage of this viewpoint is that it makes minimal assumptions about
  any noise background. As motivation, we review evidence that the auditory system
  is capable of dealing with incomplete data and, indeed, does so in normal listening
  conditions. We formulate the unreliable classification problem and show how it can
  be expressed in the framework of Continuous Density Hidden Markov Models for statistical
  ASR. We describe experiments on connected digit recognition in noise in which encouraging
  results are obtained. Results are improved by ’softening’ the missing data decision.
  We argue that if the noise background is unpredictable it is necessary to integrate
  primitive processes which identify coherent spectraltemporal regions likely to be
  dominated by a single source with a generalised recognition decode which searches
  for the best sub-set of regions which match a speech source. We describe an implementation
  of a multi-source decoder using missing data recognition and show how it improves
  recognition results for non-stationary noises.
