abstract: In this paper we study prequential model selection criteria in supervised
  learning domains. The main problem with this approach is the fact that the criterion
  is sensitive to the ordering the data is processed with. We discuss several approaches
  for addressing the ordering problem, and compare empirically their performance in
  real-world supervised model selection tasks. The empirical results demonstrate that
  with the prequential approach it is quite easy to find predictive models that are
  significantly more accurate classifiers than the models found by the standard unsupervised
  marginal likelihood criterion. The results also suggest that averaging over random
  orderings may be a more sensible strategy for solving the ordering problem than
  trying to find the ordering optimizing the prequential model selection criterion.
