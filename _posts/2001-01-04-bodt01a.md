title: Are they really neighbors? A statistical analysis of the SOM algorithm output
abstract: 'One of the attractive features of Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) is the so-called
  "topological preservation property": observations that are close to each other in
  the input space (at least locally) remain close to each other in the SOM. In this
  work, we propose the use of a bootstrap scheme to construct a statistical significance
  test of the observed proximity among individuals in the SOM.'
