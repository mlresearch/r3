abstract: This paper presents a method for using output of the computer program BUGS
  to obtain approximate profile likelihood functions of parameters or functions of
  parameters in directed graphical models with incomplete data. The method also provides
  a tool to approximate integrated likelihood functions. The prior distributions specified
  in BUGS do not have a significant impact on the profile likelihood functions and
  we consider the method as a desirable supplement to BUGS that enables us to do both
  Bayesian and likelihood based analyses in directed graphical models.
